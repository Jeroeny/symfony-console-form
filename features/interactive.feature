Feature: It is possible to interactively fill in a form from the CLI

  Scenario: Provide a value different than the default value
    When I run the command "form:name" and I provide as input
      """
      Menno[enter]
      """
    Then the output should be
      """
      Your name [Matthias]: Array
      (
          [name] => Menno
      )
      """

  Scenario: Provide no value, the default value will be used
    When I run the command "form:name" and I provide as input "[enter]"
    Then the command has finished successfully
    And the output should be
      """
      Your name [Matthias]: Array
      (
          [name] => Matthias
      )
      """

    When I run the command "form:name" and I provide as input
      """
      A[enter]
